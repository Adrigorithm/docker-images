# Introduction
These are docker images I use on machines where I don't want to clutter my enviroment. Keep in mind that when creating containers, you should usually map a volume so you don't lose work.

# What's next
NixOS. I do not understand how it works yet.

# Usage
The images are intended for remote development meaning that you shouldn't need to install anything except VS Code (or [Neo]Vim if you know what you're doing). Using plugins you can connect to the filesystem of the container and create your projects within.

## These images suck
I know, but they work.

# Why
1. "It works on my machine"
2. My supercomputer needs to remain clean to run the best games :)
3. To fuck with you
